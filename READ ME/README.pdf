STEP 1 :- Double click on 1SQLEXPR2005_ADV.exe file to start installation.

STEP 2 :- You should now see the “SQL Server Installation Center” window.Select the “Installation” tab.

                Make sure there are no failures and then click OK.

STEP 4 :- The next step is misleading. The Setup Support Files window looks like it’s doing something and stuck on “Gathering user settings
                ” It’s actually waiting for you to click the Install button.

STEP 5 :- On the Installation Type window you have a choice between “Perform a new installation of SQL Server 2008” OR “Add features to an existing instance of SQL Server 2008”. 
                You need to select new installation, NOT add features.Click next.

STEP 6 :- Next you get the Product Key window. You obviously don’t need a product key for SQL Server Express since it’s free so just click Next.
